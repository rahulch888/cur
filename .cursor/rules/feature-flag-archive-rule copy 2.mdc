### RULE: Archive a LaunchDarkly Feature Flag (Java + React)

When archiving any LaunchDarkly flag, apply the following rules:

1. Determine the final evaluated value:sdfdfdfdfdfsdf
   - final = ON  → treat flag as always true.
   - final = OFF → treat flag as always false.

2. Remove flag definition from Java backend:
   - Delete method from FeatureFlag interface.
   - Delete overridden method from implementation.
   - Remove LD variation call and any fields used only for this flag.

3. Replace all Java usages:

   3.1 If/Else:
       if (flag) { A } else { B }
       - final = ON  → keep A only.
       - final = OFF → keep B only.

   3.2 Simple If:
       if (flag) { A }
       - final = ON  → inline A without condition.
       - final = OFF → remove A entirely.

   3.3 Negated:
       if (!flag) { A } else { B }
       - final = ON  → keep B.
       - final = OFF → keep A.

   3.4 Ternary:
       flag ? A : B
       - final = ON  → replace with A.
       - final = OFF → replace with B.

   3.5 Logical:
       flag && X   → simplify to (true && X) or (false && X)
       flag || X   → simplify to (true || X) or (false || X)

4. Remove React frontend references:
   - Remove flag from feature flag hook/context/store.
   - Remove from TS interface or JS object.
   - Apply same simplification rules for JSX:
     - flag ? <A/> : <B/>
     - flag && <A/>
     - !flag && <A/>

5. Do NOT remove:
   - LD client initialization
   - Remaining flags
   - Environment variables for other flags

6. Add:
   // <flag-name> archived; condition simplified (date)
